**Predictive Analytics, Customer Segmentation, and Recommendation Systems in Banking**

This project applies Predictive Analytics, Customer Segmentation, and Recommendation Systems to solve key challenges in the banking industry. 
The aim is to leverage machine learning models to predict loan defaults, segment customers based on transaction data, and recommend relevant financial products to customers.

**Project Overview**

The project covers the following key objectives:

**Predict Loan Repayment:** Use customer financial and demographic data to build a predictive model that classifies customers as likely to repay a loan or default.
**Customer Segmentation:** Apply unsupervised learning techniques to group customers based on their transaction behavior, helping banks identify distinct customer segments for targeted marketing.
**Recommendation System:** Create a recommendation engine to suggest financial products to customers based on their interaction history, improving customer engagement.

**Features**

**Loan Default Prediction**: Supervised machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are used to predict whether a customer will default on their loan.
**Customer Segmentation**: K-Means Clustering is used to segment customers based on their transaction amounts, average transaction values, and transaction frequency.
**Recommendation System**: A recommendation engine using cosine similarity is implemented to suggest relevant products to customers based on similarities in their interaction data.

**Technologies Used**

This project utilizes a number of key technologies:

**Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, machine learning, and analysis.
**Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including loading, cleaning, and transforming data.
**Numpy**: Supports efficient numerical operations, array handling, and data transformations.
**Scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning tasks including model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing (scaling, balancing).
**Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Libraries for visualizing data distributions, correlations, and model performance.
**Faker**: Used to generate synthetic datasets, such as customer profiles and transaction histories.
**Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)**: A library used to handle imbalanced data by oversampling the minority class in loan default prediction tasks.
